# Cross Site Scripting (XSS) â€“ DOM

## Testing (UNSUCCESSFUL)
Note that browsers behave differently with regards to URL-encoding, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari will URL-encode location.search and location.hash, 
while IE11 and Microsoft Edge (pre-Chromium) will not URL-encode these sources. If your data gets URL-encoded before being processed, then an XSS attack is unlikely to work.
